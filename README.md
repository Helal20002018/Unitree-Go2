Quadruped Robot â€“ Reinforcement Learning & 3D Mapping
 Project Overview

This project was developed on the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot, focusing on reinforcement learning with NVIDIA Isaac Gym to enhance locomotion capabilities.
I also integrated advanced mapping and navigation features using LiDAR and depth camera sensors to improve environmental awareness and path planning accuracy.

 My Contributions

Reinforcement Learning with Isaac Gym: Trained the quadruped to acquire new locomotion skills with smoother and faster execution.

3D Mapping with LiDAR: Integrated a standard LiDAR to generate precise 3D scans for SLAM and navigation.

Depth Camera Mapping: Developed a mapping pipeline with RGB-D data for enhanced obstacle detection.

Navigation Optimization: Tuned scripts and system parameters to improve mapping accuracy and navigation efficiency.

Two-Leg Balance Control: Optimized stability algorithms to enable the robot to maintain balance on two legs under dynamic conditions.
