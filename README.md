Quadruped Robot ‚Äì Reinforcement Learning & 3D Mapping

üìå Project Overview

This project was developed on the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot, focusing on reinforcement learning with NVIDIA Isaac Gym to enhance locomotion capabilities.
I also integrated advanced mapping and navigation features using LiDAR and depth camera sensors to improve environmental awareness and path planning accuracy.
